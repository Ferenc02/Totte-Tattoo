## Architectural Decisions

We decided to separate bookings and consultations into different endpoints to make a thorough and clear structure, and so more of us could practice creating endpoints.

An alternative approach could have been to use a single booking model with a boolean flag for consultations, which would have simplified the backend structure since bookings an consultation share a lot of functionalities.

## Note

The consultation endpoints are not used in the frontend, but they are implemented for future use if needed. The frontend currently only uses the booking endpoints.

The consultation endpoints are implemented in the same way as the booking endpoints, but without specifing dates and times, since consultations are not time-based in the same way as bookings.
